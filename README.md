In this project, I intend to forecast CO2 values in Hawaii. Using Box-Jenkins methodology, two potential 
SARIMA models were identified and put through diagnostic checking. In diagnostic checking, neither model 
passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, but both passed all the other components of the procedure. Both 
models also had similar AICc values, with Model 1 having the lower value. Model 1 was ultimately chosen based 
on the AICc and the principle of parsimony. RStudio was the software used for statistical computing.
